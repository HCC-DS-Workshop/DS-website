I’ve loaded the libraries below for you.\nWe’re going to be using the boxplot function type ?gf_boxplot() into the console or a new chunk to get a sense of the argument this function takes.\nRecall where we left off with Activity 1.\n\nfavstats(weight~sex,data=births14)\n\n     sex  min    Q1 median    Q3   max     mean       sd   n missing\n1 female 0.75 6.435   7.19 7.785  9.68 7.017253 1.271234 495       0\n2   male 1.12 6.690   7.44 8.240 10.62 7.375485 1.318031 505       0\n\n\nThe mosaic package is nice, because all of the functions have very similar setups.\n\nMake a boxplot with the function gf_boxplot(). Copy and past the arguments from the favstats function above (don’t copy the favstats part).\n\n\ngf_boxplot(weight~sex,data=births14)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice all of the outliers! We don’t know how to remove them yet, but we will later. We can pretend they are not there by adjusting the coef argument. Set coef=5. Do that in the chunk below.\n\n\ngf_boxplot(weight~sex,data=births14,coef = 5)\n\n\n\n\nIf you remember the formula for calculating outliers (Q1-1.5 *IQR, Q3+1.5 * IQR), this is the formula R uses by default. coef = 5 changes the 1.5 to 5.\n\nPut the outliers back and figure out how to change their shape and stroke. Just like with histograms we can add change the x and y labels and add a title. Add the chunk below and change the outliers shape.\n\n\ngf_boxplot(weight~sex,data=births14,outlier.shape = 3,outlier.stroke = 2, xlab=\"Child's Birth Sex\",ylab=\"Birthweight In Pounds\",title = \"Babies Weigh A Little When Born\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you map the color (or fill) argument to the smoking habit of the mother, so we can see three variables at once?\n\n\ngf_boxplot(weight~sex,data=births14, fill=~habit, xlab=\"Child's Birth Sex\",ylab=\"Birthweight In Pounds\",title = \"New Born Babies' Weight By Mother's Smoking Habit\")\n\n\n\n\nI promise when we get to Day 3 we’ll talk about removing outliers.
