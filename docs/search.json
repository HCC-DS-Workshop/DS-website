    "text": "These are the solutions to Activity 2: Boxplots. You should try that one first.\nBoxplots are another common way of displaying numeric data. Let’s continue our exploration of births14. I’ve loaded the libraries below for you.\nWe’re going to be using the boxplot function type ?gf_boxplot() into the console or a new chunk to get a sense of the argument this function takes.\nRecall where we left off with Activity 1.\n\nfavstats(weight~sex,data=births14)\n\n     sex  min    Q1 median    Q3   max     mean       sd   n missing\n1 female 0.75 6.435   7.19 7.785  9.68 7.017253 1.271234 495       0\n2   male 1.12 6.690   7.44 8.240 10.62 7.375485 1.318031 505       0\n\n\nThe mosaic package is nice, because all of the functions have very similar setups.\n\nMake a boxplot with the function gf_boxplot(). Copy and past the arguments from the favstats function above (don’t copy the favstats part).\n\n\ngf_boxplot(weight~sex,data=births14)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice all of the outliers! We don’t know how to remove them yet, but we will later. We can pretend they are not there by adjusting the coef argument. Set coef=5. Do that in the chunk below.\n\n\ngf_boxplot(weight~sex,data=births14,coef = 5)\n\n\n\n\nIf you remember the formula for calculating outliers (Q1-1.5 *IQR, Q3+1.5 * IQR), this is the formula R uses by default. coef = 5 changes the 1.5 to 5.\n\nPut the outliers back and figure out how to change their shape and stroke. Just like with histograms we can add change the x and y labels and add a title. Add the chunk below and change the outliers shape.\n\n\ngf_boxplot(weight~sex,data=births14,outlier.shape = 3,outlier.stroke = 2, xlab=\"Child's Birth Sex\",ylab=\"Birthweight In Pounds\",title = \"Babies Weigh A Little When Born\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you map the color (or fill) argument to the smoking habit of the mother, so we can see three variables at once?\n\n\ngf_boxplot(weight~sex,data=births14, fill=~habit, xlab=\"Child's Birth Sex\",ylab=\"Birthweight In Pounds\",title = \"New Born Babies' Weight By Mother's Smoking Habit\")\n\n\n\n\nI promise when we get to Day 3 we’ll talk about removing outliers. We have to use the filter function."

    "text": "There is a data frame called penguins inside a package called palmerpenguins. In the console, you can use the view() function to open this data frame in a new tab.\nPlease insert code chunks below each question.\nUse the names() function to list all the variables in this data.\n\nPART 1. CATEGORICAL VARIABLES\nIn your view(penguins) tab, see that there are two categorical variables: species and island.\nSPECIES\nUse the tally() function to count how many penguins of each species are in this data.\nLet’s make visualizations of the above table.\nUse gf_counts() to make a bar plot of the different species. Use color and fill commands to make it more visually appealing!\nUse the mosaic() function to make a mosaic plot of the species variable.\nISLAND\nUse the tally() function to find out the penguin count on each island for this data set. BE CAREFUL! Do not click “islands” suggestion! That is the name of different data set that RStudio is recognizing!\nLet’s make visualizations of the above table.\nUse gf_props() to make a bar plot of the island variable. Use color and fill commands to make it more visually appealing!\nUse the mosaic() function to make a mosaic plot of the island variable.\nSPECIES ON EACH ISLAND\nUse the tally() function to count the number of each different species on each of the different islands. (This is a 2-by-2 contingency table!)\n\n\n\nIntepret the values in the above table. Which species/island combination is most represented in this data? In words, what do the zeros mean?\nLet’s make visualizations of the above table.\nUse gf_percents() to make a bar plot of the different species and the fill = to color each bar according the island variable. This allow us to see for each species, how many came from each island.\nUse the mosaic() function to make one mosaic plot of the species and island variables together.\nFor an extra challenge, let’s try adding color.\nUse the highlighting argument to specify a variable to highlight with variable name in quotes.\nFor example, highlighting = “species”.\nUse the highlighting_fill argument to specify your colors. In this case, three colors are needed.\nFor example, highlighting_fill = c(“color1”, “color2”, “color3”) Insert your color names inside quotes!\n\n\nPART 2. ONE NUMERICAL VARIABLE, ONE CATEGORICAL VARIABLE\nRecall from class how we made comparative side-by-side boxplots using the county data. We did this by taking the numerical variable of poverty rates (called poverty) separating the poverty rates into two groups based on the “yes or no” levels of the categorical variable metro. Recall that metro was “yes” if county has a large urban metro area) or “no” (county does not have a large urban metro area.)\nThe code we used for this is given below:\n\ngf_boxplot(poverty ~ metro, data = county)\n\n\n\n\nUse this same idea to make comparative side-by-side boxplots of the numerical variable called body_mass_g which gives the weight of the penguins in grams.\nWhich penguin species has the largest median weight? Did any species have outliers? Which species has the smallest IQR (DO you remember how to see IQR in a boxplot?) Do any species data show skew? Symmetric?\nUse the same technique above with favstats() to find all the major summary statistics of body_mass_g for all three species using just one line of code! Be careful of the order of the variables! What happens if you reverse them? (Notice in the output that there is missing data.)\nUse the same technique above to compute IQR for each species. Again, be careful of the order of the variables!You need to use an argument to remove missing data.\nWhich species has the least variability in the middle 50%? Does this agree with what you saw in the side-by-side boxplots?\nMake a histogram of body mass faceted by species and also colored by species.\n\n\nPART 3. TWO NUMERICAL VARIABLES - SCATTERPLOTS AND CORRELATION.\nIt seems plausible that, regardless of species, penguins with larger body mass could also have longer flippers and a longer bill. Let’s make scatterplots for each of these variables to examine their relationship with body mass. And from the graphs, we will consider which of these two variables seems to be more highly correlated with body mass.\nFirst, make a scatterplot with bill length on the y-axis, body mass on the x-axis. (Make sure you get the correct variable names! Use the names() function or go look at the data frame! And remember y-axis variable goes first inside the function as y ~ x). Be sure to include the straight trend line to your plot with *geom_lm().\nNext, make a scatterplot with flipper length on the y-axis, body mass on the x-axis. Be sure to include the straight trend line to your plot with *geom_lm().\nFrom these two scatterplots, do you see a linear relationship? You should! Does bill length or flipper length appear to be more highly correlated with body mass or do they look about the same? In other words, do the points appear more closely clustered around the straight line in one of the scatterplots?\nLet’s dig deeper into this question by finding the value of the correlation statistic. There is missing data so include the command use = “complete”\nCompute the Correlation statistic for bill length and body mass.\nCompute the Correlation statistic for flipper length and body mass.\n\n\nPART 4. FUN CHALLENGE!\n\nMULTIVARIABLE SCATTERPLOT\nChoose one of the scatterplots above and try to map as many variables as you can to the plot. Can you get 6 of the 8 variables onto the plot?\n\n\n\nPART 5. OPTIONAL HOMEWORK!\n\n1) Finish the activity above if you have not done so already.\n\n\nAND/OR\n\n\n2) Repeat some of the same analyses on a different data frame as decribed below.\nIn the mdsr package, there is a data frame called HELPrct. The HELP study was a clinical trial for adult inpatients recruited from a detoxification unit. In the console, type ?HELPrct to learn more.\nUse categorical variables substance, homeless, sex and numerical variables cesd (measure of depressive symptoms, higher scores indicate more symptoms) and mcs (mental component score, higher scores indicate better functioning). Experiment with tally, bar plots, mosaic plots, scatterplots of cesd and mcs, correlation, etc."
