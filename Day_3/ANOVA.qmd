## Data must be in tidy format.  

-   All rows are observations

-   All columns are variables

    -   The things you are comparing must be levels of the same variable.

## Example: Are average quiz scores and test scores the same?

This would not work in R.[^1]

[^1]: This example comes from <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html>

```{r untidy-table, echo=FALSE}

classroom <- tribble(
  ~name,    ~quiz1, ~quiz2, ~test1,
  "Harper",  NA,     60,    80,
  "Emily",  80,    NA,     NA,
  "Ethan",     70,    30,   90,
  "Samuel",    80,    40,    86
  )
classroom
```

## This table is tidy

This would work in R.

```{r tidy-table, echo=FALSE}
classroom2 <- classroom %>% 
  pivot_longer(quiz1:test1, names_to = "assessment", values_to = "grade") %>% 
  arrange(name, assessment)
head(classroom2,12)
```

## There is a way to do this in R

But its gross.

```{r R-method, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
classroom <- tribble(
  ~name,    ~quiz1, ~quiz2, ~test1,
  "Billy",  NA,     "60",    "80",
  "Suzy",   "80",    NA,     NA,
  "Lionel", "70",    "30",    "90",
  "Jenny",  "80",    "40",    "86"
  )
classroom2 <- classroom %>% 
  pivot_longer(quiz1:test1, names_to = "assessment", values_to = "grade") %>% 
  arrange(name, assessment)
```

## I have students do this is a spreadsheet. 

More on this momentarily.

## Example: Are average quiz scores and test scores the same?

```{r ANOA, echo=TRUE}
results <- aov(grade~assessment, data = classroom2)
summary(results)
```

## To do an ANOVA homework problem.
