## How to get data into R. Method 1: `c()`

The data below represents doctors salaries in thousands of dollars.

| Salary |        |       |        |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 96.64  | 87.7   | 94.57 | 91.57  |
| 92.06  | 102.76 | 94.89 | 88.69  |
| 94.83  | 89.14  | 89.27 | 111.13 |
| 97.59  | 102.24 | 88.48 | 87.5   |
| 84.99  | 76.85  | 92.89 | 98.48  |
| 85.27  | 85.6   | 84.06 | 104.31 |

## Copy and paste the data into R:

Make a vector and give your data a good variable name.

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
salary <- c(96.64, 92.06, 94.83, 97.59, 84.99, 85.27, 87.7, 102.76, 89.14, 102.24, 76.85, 85.6, 94.57, 94.89, 89.27, 88.48, 92.89, 84.06, 91.57, 88.69, 111.13, 87.5, 98.48,
104.31)
```

## Do a t.test()

...to test if the average doctor's salary is \$90k.

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
pval(t.test(~salary, mu=90,alternative = "t"))
```

Notice there is no `data=` argument.

## How to get data into R. Method 2: spreadsheets.

[Here's a spreadsheet](https://www.mosaic-web.org/go/datasets/zebra-mussels.csv) on zebra mussels from mosaic-web.org.

1.  Download the spreadsheet.

2a. If R is installed on your computer, find your file in the files pane.

2b. If using an R server. Click upload, then find the file on your computer.

## Importing the data

3.  Once uploaded/located **click** the file and import.

![](../images/click-file-import.png){fig-align="center"}

4.  Check the import menu then click import dataset.

## Copy the line of code

note: If using this file for an Rmd document: in the setup chunk, copy and paste the code that appears in the console.

<br>

`library(readr)`

`zebra_mussels <- read_csv("../images/zebra-mussels(1).csv")`

<br>

Its helpful if your data is in the same folder as your .csv file.

## Try a difference of means hypothesis test with this data.

Is there a difference in the dry.mass of a zebra mussel based on the attachment?

. . .

```{r, echo=TRUE}

pval(t.test(dry.mass~attachment,data=zebra_mussels))
```
