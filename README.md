# Intro Stats with R website.
This website was created for a three day workshop on teaching statistics with R, specifically the mosaic package. 

Day 1: Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations
Day 2: Probability and Inference
Day 3: Topics

For the most part the webstie is self contained. There is a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ubYbrOS4eAG7QXU03IsgkVAYX03AULGk?usp=share_link) to a google drive folder that is used for some direct downloading of some material. Mostly so faculty can have the experiance of uploading material to a RStudio workbench.
