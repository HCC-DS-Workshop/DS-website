This is a text file, you should copy and paste this into a new .rmd file.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#This is the setup chunk. The libraries must be loaded here. type: library(mosaic) and library(openintro) below then hit the green play button in the upper right hand corner to run the chunk.

library(tidyverse)
```

1. We should always attempt to understand our data first.

view births14 in the chunk below. You can also use the `?` operator to learn more.

```{r understand-data}
view()

```

The grey rectangles are called code chunks.

To make a new code chunk you can type three tick marks ``` (the tick is above the tab key) and a curly bracket with the letter r in the middle {r}. You end a chunk with three more tick marks, like the chunks above.

2. Make a chunk below and use `favstats()` to get an idea of the summary statistics for a baby's birthweight. You can give it a name after the r like understand-data above. No space allowed in chunk names.






3. Use favstats() and a formula (use the ~) to break up the weight summary statistics by the sex of the child.

```{r two-variables}
favstats(~, data=births14)

```



4. Challenge: Add another variable to your favstats: whether the mother was a smoker or nonsmoker. The formula will be similar to the chunk above but will include a horizontal bar after the second variable. It looks like this:  | (This bar is above the return key).

```{r three-variables}

```

5. What happens when you switch the `sex` and `habit` variables in the chunk above?



6. Can you use the same formulas above for the mean() and IQR() functions?

```{r mean-iqr}

```

When you are all done press the knit (or render) button above, if everything knits correctly and there are no errors you should have a nice html file of your work.
