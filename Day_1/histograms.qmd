## How to Follow Along

<br> Open this presentation in a new browser tab. You can copy and paste code from there.

<br>

Work in the console or in a new .rmd file.

<br>

The .rmd file you can save, the console you cannot.

## Load the Libraries

```{r setup}

library(mosaic)
library(openintro)

```

## Histograms and Boxplots

Let's consider the `county` data frame.

```{r view}
county
```

## A simple histogram

Map the unemployment rate for the counties in the US in 2019.

```{r one-variable}
gf_histogram(~unemployment_rate,data = county)
```

## Function's arguments

Every function in R can take a lot of arguments. Let's type <br> `?gf_histogram` to see the arguments for that function.

|                  |              |           |                     |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|---------------------|
| object = NULL,   | binwidth,    | linetype, | subtitle,           |
| gformula = NULL, | alpha = 0.5, | size,     | caption,            |
| data = NULL,     | color,       | xlab,     | geom = "bar",       |
| ...,             | fill,        | ylab,     | stat = "bin",       |
| bins = 25,       | group,       | title,    | position = "stack", |

## Make a pretty histogram

Start with the single variable histogram: `gf_histogram(~unemployment_rate,data = county,...)` and add some arguments.

::: incremental
1.  Edit the `bins` or `binwidth`, which get priority?

2.  Edit `color` and `fill`. Which tints what? (Hint colors are in quotes, color="pink" works) [Here's a list of colors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)

3.  Add a title and caption. Remove the label from the x-axis add a good one to the y.

4.  What the heck do size, linetype, and group do?
:::

## Here's a graph that I made

```{r my-gfhist}
gf_histogram(~unemployment_rate,data=county,bins=10, color="black",fill="purple", xlab="",ylab="Number of unemployed", title="US Umeployment by county", caption="Data is as of 2019",linetype = 5,size=2)

```

## Show two variables

The histogram is a single variable graph by we can break up the data by grouping it.

```{r}

gf_histogram(~unemployment_rate,data=county,bins=10, fill = ~metro)
```

## Two variables (faceted):

Let's make two histograms side by side.

```{r two-variables}
gf_histogram(~unemployment_rate|~metro,data = county)
```

## Activity:

Open a new .rmd file and copy and [paste this code into it.](./Activity_2_Boxplots/Boxplots.txt)
