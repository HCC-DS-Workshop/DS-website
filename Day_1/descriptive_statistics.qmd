# Descriptive Statistics

We'll discuss useful functions for doing descriptive statistics.

We'll do this through the lens of the `county` dataset.

## Load the libraries

`library(openintro)`

-   This is where the data lives

`library(mosaic)`

-   This is where our statistical functions live (most of them)

## Explore the data frame

Try the following in the console.

::: incremental
1.  `View(x = county)` [^1]

2.  `names(county)`

3.  `dim(county)`

4.  ?county
:::

[^1]: The View() function is capitalized in `mosaic` but lower case when using just the `tidyverse`.

## The ? operator

The ? will bring up the help tab.

Try

::: incremental
-   ?county

-   ?mosaic

-   ?mean()
:::

## Measures of center

::: incremental
-   mean()

    -   mean(\~pop2017,data=county, na.rm=TRUE)

-   median()

    -   Find the median population from 2017

-   mode()
:::

## Measures of Spread

::: incremental
-   IQR(\~pop2017,data=county, na.rm=TRUE)

-   sd()
:::

## All summary stats()

::: incremental
-   fivenum()

-   favstats(\~pop2017,data=county, na.rm=TRUE)[^2]

-   quartile()
:::

[^2]: favstats() is the friendliest and the one we use the most

## Get specific details on each state

Find the mean population for all 50 states.

`mean(pop2017~state,data=county)`
