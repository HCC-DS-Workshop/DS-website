## How to Follow Along.
<br>
Open this presentation in a new browser tab. You can copy and paste code from there.  
<br>

Work in the console.

We'll discuss other methods (.rmd, .qmd, scripts) of working in R later.  

# Descriptive Statistics

We'll discuss useful functions for doing descriptive statistics.

We'll do this through the lens of the `county` dataset.

## Lets talk about counties

```{r map-with-schools}
#| echo: FALSE

addresses<- tibble(address=c("Westfield State University, Westfield, MA","Holyoke Community College, Holyoke,MA", "SpringField Technical Community College, Springfield, MA")) |>
geocode(address, method="osm") |>
  mutate(name = c("WSU","HCC","STCC"))

ma_cities <- us.cities %>% 
  filter(country.etc =="MA") |>
  select(name, long, lat)

ma_counties <- map_data("county", "massachusetts") %>% 
  select( long, lat, group, id = subregion)

ma_counties |> ggplot(aes(long,lat))+
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "grey50",aes(group=group)) +
   #geom_point(data=ma_cities)
  geom_point(addresses,mapping=aes(long,lat)) 
  
  
```

## Load the libraries

`library(openintro)`

-   This is where the data lives

`library(mosaic)`

-   This is where (most of) our statistical functions live 

`library(tidyverse)`

-   This is where the `view()` function lives

## Explore the data frame

Try the following in the console.

::: incremental
1.  `view(x = county)`

2.  `names(county)`

3.  `dim(county)`

4.  ?county
:::

## The ? operator

The ? will bring up the help tab.

Try

::: incremental
-   ?county

-   ?mosaic

-   ?mean()
:::

## Measures of center

::: incremental
-   mean()

    -   mean(\~pop2017,data=county, na.rm=TRUE)

-   median()

    -   Find the median population from 2017

-   mode()
:::

## Measures of Spread

::: incremental
-   IQR(\~pop2017,data=county, na.rm=TRUE)

-   sd()
:::

## All summary stats()

::: incremental
-   fivenum()

-   favstats(\~pop2017,data=county, na.rm=TRUE)[^2]

-   quartile()
:::

[^2]: favstats() is the friendliest and the one we use the most

## Get specific details on each state

Find the mean population for all 50 states.

`mean(pop2017~state,data=county)`
